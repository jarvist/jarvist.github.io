      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling recently to get CDFT jobs to converge in NWCHEM. Rather than continue to play with ~100 heavy-atom structures (of relevance to organic electronic materials) I went to a very simple system of C2H4 / C2F4. This is sometimes studied as a very simple system showing charge transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had many issues getting this job to run successfully, before realising that I needed a suitably diffuse basis set for the constraints to be applicable! It still has issues at large separations, and I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure I&amp;rsquo;m pushing the charge around in the &amp;lsquo;correct&amp;rsquo; way, but these run files may be of use to others.&lt;/p&gt;
