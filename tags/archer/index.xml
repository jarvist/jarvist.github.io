      <description>ARCHER is the new EPSRC/NERC High Performance Computing facility, the successor to HeCToR. We have early access to it during its testing phase (until 16th Dec). The transition has been extremely impressive, the new machine is stunningly powerful (#19 in the world on the Top500 Nov 2013 list, a Cray XC30 on just-fabbed Intel Ivy Bridge processors ) and everything seems to more or less just work. The login nodes are responsive, the file systems as well.</description>
