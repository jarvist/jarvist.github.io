      <description>This is a collection of bookmarks I&amp;rsquo;ve collected over the years of useful online physics notes; hopefully this will be of some use to others. My bias is as a computational physicist doing electronic structure theory for materials modelling, so all within the remit of condensed matter theory (no high energy physics, for instance, and nothing that would count as &amp;lsquo;theoretical&amp;rsquo; research for the last forty years at least). Expect little outside pedestrian quantum mechanics and statistical physics, and the one fundamental force you can actually interact with.</description>
