      <description>Julia 0.3 Release Candidate 1 has quietly appeared on the nightly builds page; release notes in the very active GitHub repository - improvements to the REPL (tab conversion of &amp;lsquo;latex maths&amp;rsquo; to unicode), and a lot of interesting linear algebra improvements.
The inaugural JuliaCon has been held, and the presentation slidedecks are already online: https://github.com/JuliaCon/presentations; videos are coming but the upload date has been pushed back as they are edited and transcribed.</description>
