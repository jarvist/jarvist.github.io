      <description>Google Reader has finally shut up shop. Eight years, many scientific papers, snippets of technology news, new music and many many blogs; we had some good times.
All the replacements currently available still seem to be a bit unsatisfying - Reader feeder updates were really quite amazingly fast, and the interface was clean. There will now be a lot of starred articles which I&amp;rsquo;ll never read, and oldÂ cached blog posts which have disappeared for ever.</description>
