      <description>Band Theory of Solids: An Introduction from the Point of View of Symmetry Simon L. Altmann Clarendon Press, 1994
This is a fairly esoteric publication. The stated intent was to provide an introductory (I guess suitable for an undergraduate course) book on solid state theory, that none the less contained a strong dose of group theory from the get go. This is an interesting idea, but I&amp;rsquo;d say that it&amp;rsquo;s only partially successful.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt more from John Ziman&amp;rsquo;s books on electronic structure, phonons, and disorder, than from any other single source. This is a little guide to his academic works.
1979 - &amp;ldquo;Models of disorder&amp;rdquo;. Though his most recent book, from the printing you would assume it was from the 50s! This is the only real attempt to write a textbook summarising all approaches to disorder in electronic structure modelling. As a pioneer of liquid metals, this was his area of expertise.</description>
