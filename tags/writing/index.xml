      <description>I believe writing notes is essential for scientific research. Both for future reference, and also to provide space to think.
I develop a lot of my understanding on paper. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve read and thought a bit about a topic, I really like starting with a fresh A4 page (or double spread) and writing down pointers to everything I know about the subject, little diagrams and snippets of mathematics. This would be wholly useless for anyone else to consult, but I find makes a good jumping off place for my thoughts, and something I can return to and rework.</description>

      <description>(Updated 2016-03-12 to re-add the links)
I am probably the last person you would want to consult on tips to write a scientific publication. I&amp;rsquo;m slow, I procrastinate, my English is not the best, much work lies on the cutting room floor - skeletons of half assembled papers. Still, &amp;lsquo;that which we are, we are&amp;rsquo;, though my skills are lacking I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in improving, and certainly enjoy reading a well written paper.</description>

      <description>Food for thought on how to structure research (Comp Sci in this case). Fundamental premise is too turn the process on it&amp;rsquo;s head, write the paper, and then go do the work. Do watch the YouTube; he&amp;rsquo;s a great lecturer!
&amp;ldquo;Most days you think &amp;lsquo;I am a worm&amp;rsquo;. This is the natural state of the researcher.&amp;rdquo;
