      <title>Gaussian: add &#39;Density=Current&#39; for post-HF</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do your electrostatics / population analysis from some expensive post-HartreeFock calculation look suspiciously similar to the HF result? You probably forgot to add &amp;lsquo;Density=Current&amp;rsquo; to your input stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why this isn&amp;rsquo;t the default, as when you are doing (hybrid)DFT calculations, the SCF density is being varied, thus the pop / electrostatics output change with functional.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pymol Ray Tracing without wasting time</title>
      <link>http://jarvist.github.io/post/pymol-ray-tracing-without-wasting-time/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I often use the nice built in &amp;lsquo;ray&amp;rsquo; raytracer in Pymol. These ray traces can take minutes to hours, and during that time I of course want to use my computer! Unfortunately, the Pymol window freezes during the ray trace, so when I switch virtual desktops it sometimes looks as if there&amp;rsquo;s a frozen terminal or similar there, which I click on, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes because I am a fool. This click gets queued up to Pymol and promptly delivered as the ray trace finishes - making the window redraw with the built in opengl, wasting all the time ray tracing, arg!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing this today during a 30 minute ray trace, I sat and thought for a few seconds and did the sensible thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyMOL&amp;gt; ray; save ray.png&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chain the commands together so that it immediately saves the ray trace image, no matter what you do to the GUI in the meantime! I wish I&amp;rsquo;d taken the few moments to think this through back in 2009 or so.&lt;a href=&#34;http://jarvistmoorefrost.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ray.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://jarvistmoorefrost.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ray.png?w=650&#34; alt=&#34;Image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
