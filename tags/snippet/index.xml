      <description>Do your electrostatics / population analysis from some expensive post-HartreeFock calculation look suspiciously similar to the HF result? You probably forgot to add &amp;lsquo;Density=Current&amp;rsquo; to your input stack.
I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why this isn&amp;rsquo;t the default, as when you are doing (hybrid)DFT calculations, the SCF density is being varied, thus the pop / electrostatics output change with functional.</description>

      <title>Pymol Ray Tracing without wasting time</title>

      <description>I often use the nice built in &amp;lsquo;ray&amp;rsquo; raytracer in Pymol. These ray traces can take minutes to hours, and during that time I of course want to use my computer! Unfortunately, the Pymol window freezes during the ray trace, so when I switch virtual desktops it sometimes looks as if there&amp;rsquo;s a frozen terminal or similar there, which I click on, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes because I am a fool. This click gets queued up to Pymol and promptly delivered as the ray trace finishes - making the window redraw with the built in opengl, wasting all the time ray tracing, arg!</description>
