      <description>A little update to the book club. It&amp;rsquo;s going well! We&amp;rsquo;ve decided to work our way through John M. Ziman&amp;rsquo;s Principles of the Theory of Solids (2nd Edition). I really like this text, as I find the style very agreeable. It&amp;rsquo;s very conversational, in it&amp;rsquo;s best bits it feels like standing at a black-board having something explained just to you, the reader.
&amp;sect; 1 introduces periodicity as the central theme of solid state physics, showing how the translational symmetry leads to multiply periodic functions, which then leads to Bloch&amp;rsquo;s theorem (that the energy eigenstates in a crystal can be written as a phase-factor / plane wave).</description>

      <description>Now that the Walsh group has a critical mass at Imperial College London, I am planning to restart the Bookclub.
Keith Butler kicked these off in Bath with the guiding words of everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite German pessimist, Arthur Schopenhauer:
 &amp;ldquo;Buying books would be a good thing if one could also buy the time to read them in: but as a rule the purchase of books is mistaken for the appropriation of their contents.</description>
